Juleslist
=========

Juleslist is an application developed by Team Ital Curry at DevCa 2013 
"Code Sprint"

We take the best ideas from Craigslist and Ebay and apply them to the local 
agricultural industry. Juleslist provides the following services : 

1. Allow visitors to see produce posted by farmers for sale
2. Allow registered buyers to submit requests for quotations from qualified farmers
3. Provide the tools to allow farmers to participate in the quotation process using SMS as well as the Internet
4. Using RADA's open data, provide guidance for both Farmers and Buyers on the pricing and production trends


This software is developed as a web application that is split in to 3 parts. 

1. The server side code - currently written in PHP lives in the src folder
2. The Internet Client - html and javascript interface to all the Juleslist functionality
3. The SMS daemon - an adapter to facilitate communication between the database and the SMS based farmers
